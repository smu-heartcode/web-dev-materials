## Development
This module is created with yarn to take advantage of the workspaces feature.
The workspace feature allow help and deploy modules to be co-developed in a single repo.
Which are then published individually and removed in the `create-heartcode-web-dev` setup.
In `create-heartcode-web-dev`, npm will be used instead.
